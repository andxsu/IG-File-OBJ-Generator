# IG-File-OBJ-Generator

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

C# based generator to make OBJ file representations of particle physics events from CMS IG files.

**TO USE**

To use, install Android Studio into its default location. The program requires an installation of ADB and checks in its default location. Features allowing the user to set a custom ADB path are coming soon.
Connect your Oculus Quest 2 device.
Run the program from the command line and pass the path of your IG file as the first argument.

Do not exit or quit the process until the "Temp Storage Cleared" message appears in the console. Otherwise you''ll just have a bunch of extracted IG data left over in your device's temp folder.
