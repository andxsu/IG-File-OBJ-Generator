Doing this because Jay said its what scientists do. Getting a little bit of work done regarding file structure. 
Started work with calorimetry metrics and their parsing. Earlier this week worked on finishing up the loader and associated issues.

Daily TODO: (The idea is to do this everyday I work so I can keep track of what I have thought of getting done across time)

1. Loading and parsing calorimetry metrics. Mathing them to associated gameobjects
2. Separate muons from the track values in the track extras so that tracker muons don't get hidden in Unity.
3. Change where files get written to on local system. Don't save to desktop anymore.

Continuing to work on the above. The file structure stuff is done, leptons are stored as separate track files. Ethan said Jay didn't seem to care much about 
calorimetry but it still gets parsed out. Jay said he wanted individual track data shown so I wrote a function to parse
that out and include it in the totalData JSON file. I need to figure out how to separate the tracks out in an efficient
tracks so that we can pair the datas to specific objects. 

Daily TODO:
1. Investigate how to load tracks into unity as their own separate game objects. 
2. Separate muons from the track values in the track extras so that tracker muons don't get hidden in Unity.
3. Change where files get written to on local system. Don't save to desktop anymore.

Got some parsing stuff done on the unity side of things. I want to find out how to make an installer that also installs ADB.
